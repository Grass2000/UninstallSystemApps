# Uninstall System Apps
<img src="https://www.serlonghi.com/project_resources/uninstall_system_apps/Launch_icon.png" align="left" width="200" hspace="10" vspace="10">Uninstall System Apps is an application that allows you to uninstall any app on your phone, even system apps, quickly and easily! <br/>
Your list of deleted apps can be exported and shared with your friends.<br/>
The idea behind this project is to create a community where people share their lists of apps selected. I've created a bunch of lists [here](https://mega.nz/#F!SHZiHYpI!yI6_Xoz7gk0uXOTJ9hRsgQ) for the most popular phones. Feel free to [upload](https://mega.nz/megadrop/nXo47K2Afi4) your list, any help is always appreciated.</br>
Uninstall System Apps is now available on the Play Store, you can join [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sernic.uninstallsystemapps)!</br>

#### WHY UNINSTALL SYSTEM APPS? 

  • DELETE MORE THAN ONE APP AT THE SAME TIME: one click is enough to remove all selected apps. <br/>

  • EXPORT YOUR CONFIGURATION: your custom list can be exported and imported on every device running Android. <br/>

  • SHARE YOUR LIST WITH EVERYONE: you can share your custom list with your friends and let them use it on their devices.<br/>

  Note: root permissions is required to uninstall system apps.
